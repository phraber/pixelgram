Description: This package will plot a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence alignment together with a user-provided phylogenetic tree.  Alignments are shown in pixel (raster) format, whereby sequences correspond to rows and follow the tree leaf order.  Options are provided to specify a reference sequence or consensus to transform the pixel view, whereby only sites that mismatch the reference sequence are shown.  This enables viewing sequence variation in light of the phylogeny.
